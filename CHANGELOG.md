# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Initial `crawlkit` module scaffold.
- Add `tui`, a shared Bubble Tea terminal archive browser used by the crawl apps for consistent `tui` command behavior.
- Improve `tui` rows with compact column rendering, pane-specific scrolling, and full-height pane borders.
- Tune `tui` pane colors and mouse-wheel buffering to better match the `gitcrawl` terminal browser feel.
- Add shared `tui` explorer controls: mouse row selection, pane-aware right-click menus, help/sort menus, and stable sorting by time/title/kind/scope/container/author.
- Align `tui` pane chrome with `gitcrawl`: wide three-column layout, split/stacked resize modes, focused pane titles, compact row headers, click-to-sort headers, and floating right-click menus.
- Make the shared `tui` explorer group-aware: left pane now shows channels/people or document parents, middle pane shows group members, and right pane shows detail/thread content.
- Polish shared `tui` detail panes with chat-style transcript rendering, document location/preview sections, chronological chat member ordering, and compact columns in narrower tmux panes.
- Fix shared `tui` pane-specific header sorting, scope sorting, and stable detail metadata labels across crawl apps.
- Render shared `tui` parent/member panes with gitcrawl-style table columns, row styling, pane-local header sorting, and a 24-line minimum layout.
- Use a gitcrawl-style viewport for `tui` detail panes so long threads and document previews scroll cleanly inside the focused pane.
- Render `tui` detail content with gitcrawl-style sections, rules, markdown-ish wrapping, and pane-width-aware chat/document previews.
- Add gitcrawl-style pane-specific sorting so group rows and member/message rows keep independent sort modes from headers or the sort menu.
- Add a gitcrawl-style `d` detail-mode toggle so noisy metadata can collapse behind compact chat/document previews.
- Add a shared `v` group-view toggle so chat archives can pivot left pane by channel, person, or thread, and document archives by parent, database, or workspace.
- Add gitcrawl-style selected-row actions for opening URLs and copying URLs, titles, or rendered detail text from the TUI action menu.
- Add gitcrawl-style `a` action-menu shortcut, context-specific action menu titles, and double-click-to-open selected archive rows.
- Add gitcrawl-style body-link actions for opening or copying links found in selected chat messages and document previews.
- Refine the shared TUI toward `gitcrawl` parity with semantic pane titles, compact readable detail by default, bounded document previews, and conversation-window fallback for unthreaded chat messages.
- Rename the public package nouns to `config`, `store`, `snapshot`, `mirror`, `state`, `output`, `tui`, and `cache`.
